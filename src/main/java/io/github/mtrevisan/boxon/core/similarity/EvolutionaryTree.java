/*
characters-based, maximum likelihood (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_phylogenetics#Maximum_likelihood)
Uses each position in an alignment and evaluates all possible trees. It calculates the likelihood for each tree and seeks the one with the
maximum likelihood.
For a given tree, at each site, the likelihood is determined by evaluating the probability that a certain evolutionary model has generated
the observed data. The likelihoodâ€™s for each site are then multiplied to provide likelihood for each tree.

# Boxon _[boˈzoŋ]_
Like [Preon](https://github.com/preon/preon), but the code is understandable...

This is a declarative, bit-level, message parser. All you have to do is write a [POJO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object) that represents your message and annotate it. That's all. Boxon will taks care of the rest for you.
